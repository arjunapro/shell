# PhpGrad mentor education platform

The project is divided into 2 parts - api and frontend
api - RESTfull api on laravel, written according to PSR
LARAVEL websockets for real-time communication
LARAVEL Passport for data protection, all routes are securely protected otherwise everything is quite simple and reliable
frontend - modern front-end nuxt with server-side page rendering (SSR) based on vue js
css - tailwind css framework used. its distinctive feature is its proximity to the base language, css, which makes it as functional and wide in application as possible. its difference from bootstrap and other frameworks is that it allows you to create your own class base, which can be customized to the needs of each specific project. in other words, on tailwind you can write bootstrap yourself the way you need it.

authorization in nuxt
the project has a video chat made using Janus WEB-RTC, which allows you to make audio-video calls with screensharing
functional online chat implemented using web-sockets and the ability to send applications (documents, pictures) and voice messages via janus
homework - contains reminders for the next lesson and a list of tasks. tasks can be dragged and reordered (vue-draggable)
system of roles (administrator, mentor, student) and the ability to switch between them
the most complex element of the system - the video chat is divided into 6 components; the main chat file controls only the location of these components on the page
page notifications with vue-notification
